## Description

Batch Uninstaller allows you to uninstall multiple apps at once. If root permission is not available, you can still delete multiple apps a lot quicker than you can using the native android implementation.

However, you will be prompted for each app uninstalled. Non Root users can not uninstall system apps. This is a limitation with the Android Operating system.


## Features

* Uninstall multiple apps at once
* Sort by date, name and size
* Filter by user and system apps
* Know how much space you are freeing up during the selection process
* Displays application name, install date and size

## Todo

* Backup system apps before uninstalling for rooted phones
